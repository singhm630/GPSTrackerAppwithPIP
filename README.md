# GPSTrackerAppwithPIP
This is a mini app, which uses the phone GPS system to track down the location of the user.
It also has an added advantage of PIP mode(Picture in Picture). 
PIP mode implies, reduction of the size of screen to the bottom right corner of the phonwe while we can still use phone for other activities.
The previous app will still function while in PIP mode.
This app is in beta stage.
